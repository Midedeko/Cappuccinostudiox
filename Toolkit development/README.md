# Toolkit development

Features and experiments shelved for later. Flesh out here before re-integrating into the main app.

## Contents

- **ANTIBOX-MASK-MODIFIER.md** – Anti box / Mask modifier for the 3D Cabinet (and Carousel when re-enabled). Boolean-style masking (hide elements inside an "anti box" volume). To be expanded with full Boolean logic later.

- **3D-CAROUSEL.md** – 3D Carousel Creation Tool: second tool mode on the 3D Cabinet page (Master box, Iso discs, Baby containers, Center cylinder, selection UX, scroll + rotation). Control panel and scene structure, config keys, and JS entry points for re-integration.
