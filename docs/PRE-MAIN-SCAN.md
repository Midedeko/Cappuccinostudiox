# Pre-main code scan (before merge to main)

Scan date: 2025. Summary of potential problems and fixes applied.

---

## Fixes applied in this pass

1. **js/storage.js — getProjectDataSync catch return**  
   The `catch` block returned an object missing `storylineTitle` and `assets`, which could cause inconsistent shape vs the success path and `def`. **Fixed:** catch now returns the same keys as `def` (including `storylineTitle` and `assets`).

2. **js/pages/project.js — setActiveItem**  
   If `state.galleryItems[index]` was undefined (e.g. out-of-range index or race), `buildExpandedMedia(item)` and `item.storyline` could throw. **Fixed:** early return when `!item`.

3. **js/pages/content-management.js — project list HTML**  
   Project `id` was used unescaped in `href` and `data-project-id`. Malicious or odd ids (e.g. containing `"`, `&`, `?`) could break URLs or attributes. **Fixed:** `id` is stringified, used with `encodeURIComponent(id)` in the href and `escapeHtml(id)` in `data-project-id`.

4. **js/pageTransition.js — dead code**  
   `sameOrigin(href)` was defined but never used. **Fixed:** removed.

## Lower priority / follow-up

- **hideLoadingScreen({ label })**: The `opts.label` argument is still passed from project.js but is no longer used (loading carousel was removed). Safe to leave; can remove the argument at call sites for clarity.
- **api/config.js**: Exposes `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to the client. This is intentional for client-side uploads (anon key is public by design). No change needed unless you want to restrict uploads to server-only.
- **ui.js carousel**: `createContent` / `updateCarousel` inject `text` into HTML. Currently `text` comes only from hardcoded `carouselSets` or (previously) loading label. If you ever feed user or API content into the carousel, escape it (e.g. with `escapeHtml`) to avoid XSS.
- **index.html admin password**: `ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'ControlRoom1'` is in front-end code. Anyone can view source and get it. Prefer moving auth to the server or a proper login flow before calling anything “admin.”
- **project-files.js**: When `projectList` is empty, `projectList[i % projectList.length]` uses `i % 0` (NaN). Current code already avoids using that for `data-project-id` (ternary with `projectIds.length`) and uses fallback images; no bug found, but worth keeping in mind if you add more uses of `projectList[index % projectList.length]` when list can be empty.

## Areas reviewed

- **Loading & transitions**: loadingScreen.js, pageTransition.js, core.js — logic and cleanup look correct; no double-reveal or missing dismiss.
- **Storage & API**: storage.js, api/projects.js, api/projects/[id].js — GET/POST and `storyline_title` / `storylineTitle` mapping consistent; error handling and fallbacks in place.
- **Project page & gallery**: project.js, projectRenderer.js — hover/preview/click flow and guards (e.g. `activeItemIndex !== null` in setHoverPreview) checked; setActiveItem now guarded for missing item.
- **Security**: escapeHtml used in project-edit renderItem and content-management list; content-management list now also escapes/encodes project id in links and attributes.
- **Project-files, index, kitchen, admin**: Init order, loading screen show/hide, and carousel init (where used) are consistent; no obvious race or missing hide.

## Recommendation

The four fixes above are in place. Consider addressing the admin password and carousel XSS hardening when you next touch those features. Then you can merge to main.
